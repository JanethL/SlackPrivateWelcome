# üëã Greet New Members Privately in Slack 

In just a few steps, we will create a Slack app to privately welcome and guide new users when they join a Slack channel. We‚Äôll breeze through the setup process, and you‚Äôll be able to return to make modifications and add your own style and custom message for a unique workspace onboarding experience!

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1280/1*mvvAvsgBv-vd2kik89moiQ.png" width="250">

The workflow will run on [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com), a
free-to-use API and workflow hosting platform, **powered by Node.js**, that will
use this repository as its project structure. Standard Library will automatically
handle Slack authentication / webhook signing and more for you, so you can
focus on just writing and modifying logic.

# Example Usage

Once you go through this initial set up, you'll be able to immediately test you slack app by leaving and joining any channel in your workspace.

# How It Works

```
1  const lib = require('lib')({token: process.env.STDLIB_SECRET_TOKEN});

3   /**
4   * An HTTP endpoint that acts as a webhook for Slack member_joined_channel event
5   * @param {object} event
6   * @returns {object} result Your return value
7   */
8   module.exports = async (event) => {

10   // Store API Responses
11   const result = {slack: {}};

13  console.log(`Running [Slack ‚Üí Retrieve Channel, DM, or Group DM by id]...`);
14  result.slack.channel = await lib.slack.conversations['@0.2.5'].info({
15    id: `${event.event.channel}`
16  });

18  console.log(`Running [Slack ‚Üí Retrieve a User]...`);
19  result.slack.user = await lib.slack.users['@0.3.32'].retrieve({
20   user: `${event.event.user}`
21  });

  
24  console.log(`Running [Slack ‚Üí Create a new Ephemeral Message from your Bot]...`);
25  result.slack.response = await lib.slack.messages['@0.5.11'].ephemeral.create({
26    channelId: `${event.event.channel}`,
27    userId: `${event.event.user}`,
28    text: `üëã Hello ${result.slack.user.name} ! Welcome to our #${result.slack.channel.name} channel. `,
29    attachments: [],
30    blocks: [],
31    as_user: false
32  });
  

35  return result;

37};
```
The first line of code imports an [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lib) package called ‚Äúlib‚Äù to allow us to communicate with other APIs on top of Standard Library:

`const lib = require(‚Äòlib‚Äô)({token: process.env.STDLIB_SECRET_TOKEN});`

Line 3‚Äì7 is a comment that serves as documentation and allows Standard Library to type check calls to our functions. If a call does not supply a parameter with a correct (or expected type) it would return an error.

Line 8 is a function (`module.exports`) that will export our entire code found in lines 8‚Äì37. Once we deploy our code, this function will be wrapped into an HTTP endpoint (API endpoint) and it‚Äôll automatically register with Slack so that every time a `member_joined_channel` event happens, Slack will send the event payload for our API endpoint to consume.

Lines 24‚Äì32 creates and posts your message using the information (parameters) that are passed in: `channelId`, `UserId`, `Text`.

You can read more about API specifications and parameters [here](https://docs.stdlib.com/connector-apis/building-an-api/api-specification/)

# Installation

**Click Open in Autocodeüëáüèº**

You will be prompted to sign in or create a free account. If you have a Standard Library account click **Already Registered** and sign in using your Standard Library credentials.

**Link a Slack Account & Deploy your Workflow**

Before we can deploy our code live, we need to link Select the **1 Account Required** red button which will prompt you to link a Slack account.

If you‚Äôve built Slack apps with Standard Library, you‚Äôll see existing Slack accounts, or you can select **Link New Resource** to link a new Slack app.

Give your project a name and **Save API Project**.

Great! You‚Äôve just saved your first project. Autocode automatically sets up a project scaffold to save your project as an API endpoint, but it hasn‚Äôt been deployed.

This means your endpoints are not yet live and can‚Äôt respond to HTTP requests or events. To deploy your API to the cloud select **Deploy API** in the bottom-left of the file manager.

# Test Your Workflow

Test your Slack app by joining or leaving any channel in your workspace. If you‚Äôve set everything up properly you should receive a warm welcome from your Slack app.

# Making Changes

There are two ways to modify your application. The first is via our in-browser
editor, [Autocode](https://Autocode.stdlib.com/). The second is
via the [Standard Library CLI](https://github.com/stdlib/lib).

## via Web Browser

Simply visit [`autocode.stdlib.com`](https://autocode.stdlib.com) and pick your project
from the left sidebar. You can easily make updates and changes this way, and
deploy directly from your browser.

## via Command Line

You can either export your project via tarball by right-clicking the project
once open on [Code on Standard Library](https://code.stdlib.com/). You can then
install the CLI tools from [stdlib/lib](https://github.com/stdlib/lib) to test,
makes changes, and deploy.

```shell
# Deploy to dev environment
lib up dev
```

Alternatively, you can retrieve your package via `lib get`...

```shell
lib get <username>/<project-name>@dev
```

# Shipping to Production

Standard Library has easy dev / prod environment management, if you'd like to ship to production,
visit [`build.stdlib.com/projects`](https://build.stdlib.com/projects),
find your project and select it.

From the environment management screen, simply click **Ship Release**.

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1440/1*JqiwC6a_zbIdTsww1BOYLQ.png" width="400">

Link any necessary resources, specify the version of the release and click **Create Release** to proceed. 

That's all you need to do!
