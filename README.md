# ðŸ‘‹ Greet new members privately in Slack 

In just a few steps, we will create a Slack app to privately welcome and guide new users when they join a Slack channel. Weâ€™ll breeze through the setup process, and youâ€™ll be able to return to make modifications and add your own style and custom message for a unique workspace onboarding experience!

The workflow will run on [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com), a
free-to-use API and workflow hosting platform, **powered by Node.js**, that will
use this repository as its project structure. Standard Library will automatically
handle Slack authentication / webhook signing and more for you, so you can
focus on just writing and modifying logic.

# Example Usage

Once you go through this initial set up, you'll be able to immediately test you slack app by leaving and joining any channel in your workspace.

# How It Works


# Installation


# Test Your Workflow

# Making Changes

There are two ways to modify your application. The first is via our in-browser
editor, [Code on Standard Library](https://code.stdlib.com/). The second is
via the [Standard Library CLI](https://github.com/stdlib/lib).

## via Web Browser

Simply visit [`code.stdlib.com`](https://code.stdlib.com) and pick your project
from the left sidebar. You can easily make updates and changes this way, and
deploy directly from your browser.

## via Command Line

You can either export your project via tarball by right-clicking the project
once open on [Code on Standard Library](https://code.stdlib.com/). You can then
install the CLI tools from [stdlib/lib](https://github.com/stdlib/lib) to test,
makes changes, and deploy.

```shell
# Deploy to dev environment
lib up dev
```

Alternatively, you can retrieve your package via `lib get`...

```shell
lib get <username>/<project-name>@dev
```

# Shipping to Production

Standard Library has easy dev / prod environment management, if you'd like to ship to production,
visit [`build.stdlib.com/projects`](https://build.stdlib.com/projects),
find your project and select it.

From the environment management screen, simply click **Ship Release**.

Link any necessary resources, specify the version of the release and click **Create Release** to proceed. 

That's all you need to do!
